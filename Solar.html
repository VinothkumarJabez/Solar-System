				<h2 id="sun">Sun</h2>
				<P>The sun is a star, specifically a G-type main-sequence star, that resides at the center of our solar system. It's a massive, hot plasma ball that generates energy through nuclear fusion, radiating primarily as visible light and infrared radiation. The sun's gravity keeps all the planets and other objects in our solar system in orbit.
				</P>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
				<p>Mercury is both a chemical element and the innermost planet in our solar system. As a chemical element, it's a heavy, silvery metal with symbol Hg and atomic number 80, known for being liquid at standard temperature and pressure. As a planet, Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun, orbiting it in just 88 Earth days.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
				<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is known as Earth's "twin" due to its similar size and mass. It's also the hottest planet in our solar system, with a dense, cloud-covered atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide. Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
				<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It's a rocky planet with a solid and active surface, including mountains, valleys, and plains. 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, making it an "ocean planet".  
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
				<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" due to its rusty, reddish appearance. It's a rocky, cold, and desert-like planet with a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, and its surface gravity is about one-third of Earth's. 
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
				<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun 
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
				<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second-largest in our solar system. It's a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and is famous for its spectacular ring system. Saturn is also known for its many moons, at least 61 confirmed, including the largest, Titan.  
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
				<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a blue-green ice giant. It's known for its extreme axial tilt, making it appear to rotate on its side. Uranus is made up primarily of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase, and its atmosphere has a complex cloud structure. 
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
				<p>Neptune is the eighth and outermost planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is an ice giant, the fourth-largest planet by diameter, and the third most massive. Neptune is known for its vibrant blue color, which is caused by methane in its atmosphere
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="pluto">Pluto</h2>
				<p>Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune in our solar system. It was formerly considered the ninth planet but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Pluto has a thin atmosphere and a surface composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. It is also known for its five moons, including the largest, Charon. 
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h2 id="moon">Moon</h2>
				<p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits Earth at an average distance of 384399 km. The Moon's orbital period and rotation period are synchronized by Earth's gravitational pull at 29.5 Earth days, making the same side of the Moon always face Earth.
